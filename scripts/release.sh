# One command to cut a release.
#
# Why it exists: the correct sequence is seven steps in a precise order, and
# skipping one raises no error — it just leaves the repo in a quiet,
# inconsistent state. That is what happened here: v1.0.0 was cut and then main
# moved six commits past it, so the Releases page kept offering a snapshot in
# which privacy had no screen of its own and the navigation was still in its
# earlier shape. Nothing was broken and nothing was red. The drift is invisible
# by construction, which is why it needs a procedure rather than a memory.
#
# What this does NOT decide is when. That stays a judgement call: a release
# means what someone downloads is meaningfully different from what they would
# have downloaded before. This only makes sure that once you have decided,
# nothing gets left half-done.
#
# Everything irreversible (the tag, the push, the release) happens after every
# precondition has been checked.
#
# Usage:
#   npm run release                        patch:  1.1.0 -> 1.1.1
#   npm run release -- minor                       1.1.0 -> 1.2.0
#   npm run release -- 2.0.0               explicit version
#   npm run release -- minor --notes n.md  prose release notes from a file
#   npm run release -- --dry-run           print what it would do, do nothing
#
# Without --notes the release is created with GitHub's generated notes, which
# are a commit list. Fine for a small fix; for anything a reader would want to
# understand, write the file.
